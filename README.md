# TOS-The-Game

This game is designed to test how well you actually read the TOS (Terms Of Service) agreements of services you've probably signed up for. 
You'll be asked a series of questions about what is or isn't included in the TOS agreements of common services. 
The game will also give you a brief explanation of why it's included and will list other services with similar features in their TOS's.

All the code is in main.py just download it make sure you have tkinter installed and run it!
